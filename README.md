### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?
  

Add your response here: I felt unprepared to complete the useState in fetching data from the API

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
  
Add your response here: If I had more time, I would want to do more stretch features and add more css styling

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

Add your response here: I came into this project alot more prepared I felt but it definately was more tasking that week 1, I planned to do more stretch features but I was only able to complete 1. Alot of my peers did all the stretch features so I plan to do better as well
